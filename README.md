# UNO.io
A multiplayer/singleplayer io card game.

Demo here: http://cardgame.uno/login

## Known bugs
- The first card doesn't affect the game
- Can't re-join the game
- Rooms with bots don't disappear

## Additional Rules to implement
  - Can stack +2 (The player can play a +2 instead of drawing card, the next player must draw 4 cards if he hasn't a +2)
  - Can stack +4 (Same of +2)
  - Can draw only if can't play any card
  - Can Anticipate
  - Can Challenge a +4
  - Can play stacked cards (Can play more cards in a turn),
  - Can play stacked cards only If has the same type and the same color (Will work only if CanPlayStackedCards IS true)

## Future Features
- GOOD DESIGN
- Insert a round timer, if timer stops and the user do nothing, the user draws and skips a turn.
- Block who's AFK (after 3 times straight user's timer stops)
- Insert Chat
- Use ThreeJS in-game

## Nice to have
- Insert statistics and analytics
- Showing stats in charts - (maybe from https://recharts.org/en-US/examples/SimpleLineChart)
- Insert Point Counter
- Insert sounds
- Insert voice chat
